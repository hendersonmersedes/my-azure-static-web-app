    <p>Technology has always peaked my interest. I used to tear apart CD players, radios, and VHS players just to see how they worked.
      When I was around 14 years old I took a computer class that taught me basic HTML and CSS. I never really took it serious until
      I got burntout on the customer service roles and my Bachelors Degree in Humanities just wasn't doing much.
      I decided to try my hand at SQL around the beginning of COVID. I enrolled back in college to get a 2nd Bachelors degree but this time it was
      Information Technology. The studies were really taking a toll on me mentally and I needed a higher paying role earlier than when I was expected to graduate.
      My job at the time was offering free Microsoft exam so I took the Office365 exams along with Dynamics CRM and ERP. I started posting more about my journey
      on Linkedin and immediately I was being contacted for tech roles.</p>
